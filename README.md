# Features 

**User Authentication with handling errors**

Help has its very own sign-in and sign-up user authentication system which allows users to become a member and to access features that are only available for member only. Whenever a user input is invalid the user will be prompted with error messages that will notify user for their correct inputs.

**Business Index and Show Page**

Help's business page displays information on all businesses including title of business and an image for users to view. If a user is interested in a particular business they can click on the business and will be redirected to the show page. The show page consists of more indepth information which includes, hours of operation, address, and reviews from other Helpers! 

**Reviews**

Users are allowed to write a review and give a rating to specific businesses only if they are logged in to an account. Users will be prompted with an error message if they attempt to submit a review if they are not logged in to Help.
